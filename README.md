# SSAC_FAST_CAMPUS_Project

 - Project subject: Classify the deviants from card company using customers' data

 - Project term: 2021.02.19 ~2021.02.02


**There are csv files on repo. These are from Kaggle that contain card service customers' information'**

**Our team use these data to classify the Deviants(attrited customers).**

**This model classify the target of 96% or more accuracy.**

**If you want to download the date we preprocessing or scaling, refer to address below**

## 1.Before start
- All the sourcecodes are written in Jupyter Notebook + Window 10 OS
- Download the data from Kaggle or on repo
- Change the file location code

## 2.Starting
- If you change the file location code, you can run all the code in the Jupyter Notebook file

## 3.Using tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python(sklearn)
- ML models(gradiant boosting, xgboosting, LightGBM, Catboosting etc.)

## 4.Contributed
- gathering data, preprocessing, scaling, visualization, trial in different data formats(PCA, SMOTE etc.)...
- Hyeong Jun, Song
- Jung-A, Kim

## 5.TODO
- Need to make this model have input-box and output-box to classify new data
- Try another hyper parameter to make this model more efficient
